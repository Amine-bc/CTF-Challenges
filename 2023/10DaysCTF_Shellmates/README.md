# 10DaysCtfChallenge

***As members in the technical team of shellmates we always create ctf challenges for ctf competetions, but this time it's a bit different, we were asked to create a ctf challenge during 10 days in order to guarantee our place at the team.***

## Let the work begin !
#### First I tought to create an IOT ctf but I hadn't enough knowledge for that, and I needed some hardware materials.
#### Then since I was working on emulating a cpu architecture machine I tought of creating a ctf tackling memory management in a cpu.
